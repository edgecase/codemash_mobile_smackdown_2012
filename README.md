# CodeMash Mobile SmackDown IronChef Editiion 2012 

Wow, that's a session title and a half! Anyway, it's been requested and here it is. There's a few 
anti-patterns in here, most of the code is not optimized or anything just something to get up and 
running in front of a live crowd to see how iteration 0 or an MVP (minimum viable product) would
be done. Take the code with a grain of salt and be sure to do additional research when pulling 
anything here for your own use as it's only a sample app that could be created quickly in front of 
others while still showing some of the more wiz-bang or seemingly complex features of iOS 5.

Any questions, comments, etc just holler at Leon@edgecase.com or send me a pull request. 

Also, notes was an originall discussed feature that no longer need to be implmented so it's only a start of an implementation and 
is not expected to work. 

Be well!
